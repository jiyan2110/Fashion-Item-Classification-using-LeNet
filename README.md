# Fashion-Item-Classification-using-LeNet

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the classic LeNet-5 architecture to classify fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- LeNet-5 inspired CNN
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images
- Output: 10 classes (e.g., Shirt, Sneaker, Dress, etc.)

## 📦 Dataset
- Fashion-MNIST: A dataset of Zalando’s article images
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🎯 Objective
To build an efficient deep learning model for accurate classification of fashion items and understand how classical CNN architectures like LeNet perform on modern datasets.
